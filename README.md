# John-Cena-Extension

This is an extension that I made at Unhackathon Fall 2015. It's a basic Chrome extension that replaces all the images in your browser with pictures of John Cena, inserts John Cena quotes into random text nodes, and plays his theme song on startup, as sort of prank. Future updates will involve making it easily modifiable so that users may change images or quotes or autoplay music.
