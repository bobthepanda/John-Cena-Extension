# John-Cena-Extension

# This is an extension that I made at Unhackathon Fall 2015. It's a basic Chrome extension that replaces all the images in your
# browser with pictures of John Cena, inserts John Cena quotes into random text nodes, and plays his theme song on startup, as a
# sort of prank. Future updates will involve making it easily modifiable so that users may change images or quotes or autoplay
# music.
